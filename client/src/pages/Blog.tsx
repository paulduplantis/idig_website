                  Introduction to i<em>DIG</em>
                </h3>
                <div className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
                  <p>I have to admit, I don't know what i<em>DIG</em> will become or if it will become anything of note for that matter. All I know is I needed to build it. Maybe just to prove to myself I could but also to possibly start a conversation around what role the individual has in the information they create, consume, and share. Should they be in the driver seat or merely the passengers? Should they be in control of their experiences or should these experiences become available to the highest bidder?</p>
                  
                  <p>I have lived long enough to watch the birth of the web founded on the principles of openness and collaboration evolve into a siloed web of influence we see today. Certainly much good has come from it but it would be hard to argue that people are in control.</p>
                  
                  <p>But what if they were in control and the resulting experiences were centered on providing agency and privacy? What if every element they engaged with was intended to spark curiosity and understanding of a subject to provide context and clarity in service of the quality of interactions rather than just the quantity of them.</p>
                  
                  <p>To me i<em>DIG</em> is an experiment to explore the possibilities of this intention to service quality over quantity. What I am launching today is what I am calling Phase I. This is in an Alpha test phase and is a very rough sketch of an idea I have been carrying for over 20 years.</p>
                  
                  <p>The rise of GenAI allowed me to manifest these ideas into reality as I am neither a coder nor a software developer. Not to say blood, sweat, and tears were not shed over the last year, as i<em>DIG</em> was built from scratch. I can say from experience that GenAI does not magically build solutions for you, especially at this level.</p>
                  
                  <p>But moving forward I don't see i<em>DIG</em> as a traditional company to own these ideas but more of a path to explore. Or if I do find traction, the only path I could see moving forward to maintain quality of experiences in scaling this framework would be to set up a worker co-op to provide resonant ownership of the framework to every person involved in the growth of it.</p>
                  
                  <p>But at the very least, maybe this effort inspires potential collaborators to work with me on seeing where this path will lead or maybe it inspires somebody to build something on their own to provide agency and privacy to people. It doesn't matter to me. I just want to be part of the conversation.</p>
                  
                  <p>In service of this conversation, I am also launching the i<em>DIG</em> blog which will feature ideas and updates on the i<em>DIG</em> framework journey as well as The Resonant Builders Monthly which will be a monthly newsletter to feature recent blog posts but more importantly feature what other builders are up to in service of building a web more in tune with people being in control of their experiences.</p>
                  
                  <p>I am also wrapping up a book on this journey titled We the Resonant Builders. Coming soon!</p>
                  
                  <p>I argue what is possible when more people start to build for the health of the connection more than the wealth extracted from it. This is the conversation I want to start.</p>
                  
                  <p>With i<em>DIG</em>, I personally want to explore new methodologies to surface opportunities for resonant alignment between people and information. I have been recently researching quantum social sciences theory and how this might help define what I call the i<em>DIG</em> attractor that is in development. I just think we are ready to evolve beyond traditional filtering for the way we discover information. I will be writing more about this in my next blog post!</p>
                  
                  <p>Again, I really don't know what i<em>DIG</em> is. I almost don't want to define it. Maybe it's part hobby and part obsession. All I know is I have built the foundation of it and am ready to explore where it can go. More importantly what I might uncover from what other people are building that could help mold this into something more than what I can imagine and possibly inspire others to build what they have not imagined.</p>
                  
                  <p>But the end goal is to build tools for people to harness their own potential and purpose, not in service of what is built but what resides within them. Tools to help people align resonantly with opportunities, resources for social services, news, or what interests them.</p>
                  
                  <p>This tool is not special. People are or can be special. This tool is to illuminate this potential, not influence it.</p>
